                I absolutely adore music. It has been with my ever since I was very young, and it still very much remains an integral part of my life. There would be times that I stray away from music, but I still find myself coming back to it, even if it's a different artist or genre. I also am an independent songwriter, and I have written some songs myself. Here are a few examples of my music:

                    <p>I wrote this song primarily for academic purposes. We were asked to create a short film (virtual, because of the pandemic) for our Understanding the Self class, and this became its main soundtrack. The song talks about resting from your personal battles, and a realization that it is alright to stop at times. It also talks about hope, that "the sun will rise again" and "darkness will soon go away". I personally relate to this song, and it is one of my popular written songs.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    It was only in 2018 that I have found my love for Indie OPM. I have always found myself not liking mainstream just because it feels too simple back then, or it is overly-marketed that artists gain aggressive fans that keep fighting other fans. But that is not to say that I hate the artists themselves. They are actually great, but the fans ruin it for me most of the time. When I was introduced to Indie OPM, it felt like a breath of fresh air. It was new to my ears—something that I was longing for. I started listening to one artist, and then another, and then I found myself creating a playlist for the Indie OPM songs that I adore the most, which brings us to my top three favorite Indie OPM artists as of now:

                            Ben&Ben is a band composed of 9 members, with iconic twin vocalists. Their genre is mainly Folk Indie, turned Folk Pop after they rose into popularity. They try to incorporate percussions with modern instruments such as electric guitars and synths, and that is why I love them a lot. Ben&Ben has always been close to my heart ever since I started listening to them. I chose to feature their song, "Kathang Isip", because it served as my gateway into the fandom.

The band started as rivals in De La Salle Santiago Zobel, and they would always compete against each other in battle of the bands competitions. Later on, they decided to merge and perform as a whole for their graduation ball. "Lola Amour" is the name of the grandmother of Pio Dumayas, the lead vocalist, and has been the official name of the band.

                            Bruno Major is a British singer-songwriter and guitarist who debuted in 2017. He began his career as a guitarist at the age of 16, playing for renowned musicians at that time. I love his music because of its calming and slow nature. His guitar-playing skills is also great, which elevates his music on an even higher plane. I chose to feature his song, "Nothing", because it is a love song that allows the concept of self-honesty. It assures you that when you're in love, it's okay to be fully you.

                            The Japanese House is a musician that goes by the name of Amber Mary Bain. She comes from England, and pursued her music career while she was a teenager. She then started using her current moniker, The Japanese House, while writing songs way back in 2012, with experimental dream pop, electro-pop, and folktronica style. I chose her song, "Maybe You're The Reason", mainly because of the dreamy atmosphere that the song gives. However, it is not to confuse that the song actually talks about depression and the lack of meaning from everything. It then gives an idea that we can continue to live by loving someone.

                            PREP is an alternative/indie band consisting of four members. Their music mainly incorporates elements of jazz, funk, and electro-pop. If I were to pick my favorite style of alternative/indie, it would be their music. Because I adore jazz, funk, and electro-pop, I greatly adore their music as well. I chose "Futures" as their featured song, and it is about unrequited love. The perspective of the song is a person who has a love interest, but that love interest moves away with someone else. Musically, the song is calm, full of details, and matched with great vocals.

                <div class="title"><h2>Korean Popular Music<br>(Korean Pop or K-Pop)</h2></div>
                <div class="description">
                    Another genre of music I love most is Korean Pop. Though I am more into bands, solo artists, and duos, rather than idol groups. I also am fond of Korean Indie, because there are so many great artists that I discover. Their songs are also featured in Korean dramas, which helps their music career rise into fame. Here are three of my favorite Korean Pop artists:

                        <div class="artist-name"><h3>OKDAL<br>(Rooftop Moonlight)</h3></div>
                        <div class="artist-desc">
                            OKDAL, or known in English as "Rooftop Moonlight", is a female pop duo that debuted last January 2010. They usually perform their songs with keyboard, melodica, and xylophone, but also use other instruments. I love their music because most of it talks about positivity, and its message is usually to reassure and/or comfort people. I chose "Beautiful As You Are", because it is about how you are beautiful from the moment you were born. It also talks about how the world may try to bring us down, but we will always shine wherever we are because we are always beautiful on the inside.

I chose one of his famous songs, "Don't Be Sad", because it is about how much you're willing to sacrifice just to make your loved ones happy, even if you're flawed yourself.

                            LambC is a solo singer-songwriter and producer who debuted in 2015. His songs consists of multiple influences from different genres, primarily electro-pop or synth pop. In April 2020, he started to form a band names MOTIP, which consists of three members. From his personal music, I chose "Childish". It talks about how love seemed to be childish due to pure intentions, such as continuous showers of compliments, exaggerated confessions of love, and the never-ending thought of loving your significant other.

                    Lastly, I want to talk about my fourth favorite genre: Japanese Pop. J-Pop currently is dominated by idol groups, but again, I am more fond of bands, soloists, and duos. Japanese pop is greatly influenced by the West ever since it became a thing. And now, artists are trying to experiment by incorporating elements of jazz, funk, rock, and other rising genres into their music. Here are my three current favorite J-Pop artists:

The band consists of four members, and has been creating music which were featured in multiple Japanese animated series.

Their debut song, "Yoru ni Kakeru", became a huge hit, placing on the top of Billboard Japan Hot 100, and retaining its place in the weekly charts for six (non-consecutive) weeks and the year-end chart. I chose "Gunjou", a single which is about a personal struggle with emotions and confidence. It then turns into finding relief from these struggles and putting everything into what you love to do. It also talks about being genuine, and letting your true self resonate.
