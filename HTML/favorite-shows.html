        If I do not respond during my free time, chances are that I am watching something. I find it hard to completely shift from doing something to doing nothing in a short amount of time, so to help me transition to that state, I watch animé or shows on Netflix. I am not a picky watcher, but I would rather watch romance, comedy, and drama rather than action, horror, thriller, and suspense. That is why, I will talk about my favorite moving pictures in general categories.

        <div class="description">
            I have watched a lot of movies, but there are a few distinctions that I am willing to watch all over again. All of my featured movies are from an amazing studio named Studio Ghibli (pronounced as /gi-blee/). They are a Japanese studio that has made animated films since 1985, and has been recognized internationally for their craft. Without further ado, here are my top three movies:

                <div class="details">Adapted from the book, "Howl's Moving Castle"</div>
                <div class="show-description">
                    I love the magical attributes of this story. It talks about fearlessness, deep connections, and perseverance. Howl's Moving Castle has taught me about the virtue of courage, that no matter what I face, I can keep my head held high and press on with my right foot forward. The masterful direction of this movie is captivating for all audiences, and has always been something I greatly appreciate. Since watching this years ago, I still get excited about watching it again.

                <div class="director">Directed by: Hayao Miyazaki</div>
                <div class="details">Winner of Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards</div>
                <div class="show-description">
                    Spirited Away is another fantastical story of a girl's soul that drifted away to a world where spirits dwell. She is faced by multiple challenges, one being the transformation of her parents into pigs. I absolutely adore this story because it shows about respect to our surroundings and to the spirits that dwell in it. It has taught me that in times of challenges, no matter how big, we must always be ready to face it. It is also one of the early films that I've watched, which taught me about the virtue of friendship in times of need. We meet many people in the entire span of our lives, and even if we feel like we forget them, the movie implies that we do not. They just simply sit at the back of our conscience, and will always resurface once we get reconnected to them.

                <div class="details">41st in the "100 Best Films of World Cinema" by Empire in 2010</div>
                <div class="show-description">
                    My Neighbor Totoro is a fantasy film set in a rural area in post-war Japan. It revolves around the concept of animism, specifically on the encounter of two children with friendly wood spirits. This movie taught me about respect for my environment. Ever since watching the movie, I would always keep in mind that whenever I am in a place surrounded by nature, I must take extra steps in respecting the environment. It gave me an early insight on one of the dominant beliefs in Japan, which is Shintoism. It is one of the earliest animated films that I have watched, and I still am fond of it up to this day.

        <div class="description">
            I generally named it Television Shows because I watch multiple show formats: series, musicals, reality television, and others. I will be focusing on three of my most favorite shows, which I still love up to this day. I have watched multiple shows, but these three are those that I know will remain in my heart for the next several years, if not decades.

                <div class="details">Nominated for multiple awards, including Emmy's</div>
                <div class="show-description">
                    Among all of the thriller television series that I've watched, How to Get Away With Murder still remains my favorite. It revolves around Annalise Keating (played by Academy-Winner Viola Davis) and her selected law students. They encounter huge issues in every season, which was masterfully connected in each episode from beginning. While it may give justification to the concept of lying, the show also talks about the importance of friendship and cooperation, especially in tight situations. It also has provided queer representation, as well as significant character developments as Annalise goes through alcoholism and indentity crisis.

                <div class="details">Multi-award-winning Television Show initally released on FX</div>
                <div class="show-description">
                    Pose is a television show that I thought I will never be fond of. To begin with, I have always had my reservations for the Trans community, due to my religious bias and societal norm. However, this show changed all of that. It provided an insight about how it was like to live as Trans, as well as how people are allowed to choose their own families if their original family kicks them out. It talks about friendship, accountability, courage, and even perseverance, as the casts of the show built their reputation from the ground up.

                    I watch a lot of reality television shows, but RuPaul's Drag Race was one of the few that I greatly adore. Drag Race has helped me be comfortable with myself, and as a queer teenager with not much representation or role models to look at, this show has given me a sense of belongingness to a community that I was in but was emotionally disconnected to. It also opened me to the drag culture, and helped me gain knowledge about the entire queer community. I am very thankful to this show because I am now much more open to a lot of things.

            I had to create a separate section because my fondness for animé is immense. From a very young age, I have always been into animé. I have made friends, established connections, and even had a better perspective of my sense of self because of animé. I have a lot of shows that I love, but I will only be focusing on three. Here are some of my favorite animé series:

                <div class="show-description">
                    Out of all the Boy's Love animé that I watched, this is the best because aside from being a BL animé, it is also a music animé. It revolves around acceptance, newfound love, and realistic progress through life challenges. Character developments are also organic, due to their realistic approach to problems and to finding their way through it. It is also one of the few animés that does not heavily sexualize the concept of same-sex relationships between men. It is pure, pleasantly comedic, and light-hearted to watch. Whenever I have friends who want to try watching BL animé, this is always my recommendation.

                <div class="show-description">
                    I have not watched this series until last year, and it has been a great series to watch. It is also fun and light-hearted, which makes it easy to digest and watch whenever I want to relax. The characters are also very distinct from one another, and while it may portray heavily unrealistic standards, it is still somehow relatable for teenagers. Whenever someone asks me for recommendation of something that is light-hearted, I would recommend this to them.

                <div class="show-description">
                    Magi is one of the few fantasy animés that I absolutely love. The long-running series revolves around the concept of friendship, bravery, and victories. While the plot progresses, the anime is far from being serious. In fact, it is a well-written comedic animé. Character developments are also organic, which makes it relatable in some parts. I will absolutely remain adoring this animé for its plethora of personalities and plot progression.
