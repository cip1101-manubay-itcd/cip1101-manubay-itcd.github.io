        <div class="description">
            <p>I haven't planned that far into the future yet, because I always try to live in the moment. It saves me from the disappointment of not achieving what I tried to achieve, and it helps me keep in touch of my present dealings. But, for the sake of this article, I will be talking about my plans in general.

                    <p>I think everyone who is currently studying in college right now feels the same way as I do. I want to get my bachelor's degree on-time, and then let my future unfold to see if I will pursue post-graduate studies. I think this is the biggest thing that I want to achieve in the closest time-frame available.</p>

                    <p>I love my country, but I am looking forward to exploring what other countries have to offer. I want to be able to work in a new environment as a challenge for my flexibility and adaptability. I also know that there are bigger opportunities for me outside Philippines, that is why I am set on getting a job overseas as soon as I possibly can.</p>

                    <p>This may seem very materialistic, but there is a part of me that feels that way. I have been in situations wherein money was a big problem, specifically the scarcity of it. I know how it feels like to not have as much money as I need, and not being able to do anything about it. That is why, my plan is to earn as much money as I can. I want to take this as a repayment to myself and my family, that I am finally able to buy the things I want to buy.</p>

                <div class="plan-desc">
                    <p>While I love my family very much, I also have plans of living separately from them. That does not mean I will cut off my relationship with them, but rather as a lesson on independence and maturity. I want to be able to get to know myself in a deeper level without having to adhere to rules that were set inside a house that I do not own. I love freedom, and I will make sure that I am capable of settling alone before I start doing so.</p>

                    <p>With the money I earn from my job, I want to make sure that I get regular check-ups, or even regular psychiatric counseling. I know that I am not the healthiest, and my lifestyle is a testament to that. I also know that I am not the most emotionally-stable, and it affects the other aspects of my life. So, as a repayment to myself, for the years of stress, I will make sure that I get the medical attention I need. I still want to live long, and I think that would be the best way for me to see that through.</p>
