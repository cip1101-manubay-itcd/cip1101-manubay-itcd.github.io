            <strong>My interests are deeply connected with my current skills and hobbies</strong>.<sup>1</sup> I am interested in music, specifically in <strong>music production and songwriting</strong>.<sup>2</sup> I have written songs myself, and I find the process fascinating, even if it is sometimes tiring.<sup>3</sup> I am also interested in art, specifically in <strong>paintings</strong>.<sup>4</sup> I love how emotions are translated to brush strokes, and how each piece gives you a specific feeling when you look at them.<sup>5</sup> That is why I promised myself, that when I go to other countries, I will try to go to art museums to understand their culture through art.<sup>6</sup> I am also interested in <strong>Japan</strong>, specifically in their culture and history.<sup>7</sup> I have always wanted to work in Japan, and I am fully aware of the above-average intensity of their work culture.<sup>8</sup> I am very fascinated about how they function as a country, and how they manage to instill their values even to younger generations.<sup>9</sup> Because of this, <em>I have started learning their language and writing system</em>, though I have a long way to go.<sup>10</sup> I am interested in computers, specifically <strong>software programming and cybersecurity</strong>.<sup>11</sup> I am fascinated about how people can protect systems, as well as how people can penetrate these protections.<sup>12</sup> I am also quite fond with how software is made.<sup>13</sup> I see myself pursuing a job opportunity related to software programming or cybersecurity.<sup>14</sup> Another thing that interests me are games, specifically <strong>game production and development</strong>.<sup>15</sup> If software programming and cybersecurity does not work to my favor, I find myself seeking opportunities in the field of game development.<sup>16</sup> I am fond of behind the scenes in game development, particularly the way games are designed and developed over time.<sup>17</sup> And this interest was intensified by a project we had last semester, wherein we had to individually create games using Java.<sup>18</sup> I am proud of the game I made, and I have plans of developing it further.<sup>19</sup> I am also interested in <strong>graphic design</strong>.<sup>20</sup> I wish to have proper equipment and software for graphic design in the future.<sup>21</sup> I think this will be a part-time job opportunity for me when I graduate.<sup>22</sup> And I also love designing myself, so I will probably not get tired of it easily.<sup>23</sup> <em>I also want to take proper classes in design</em> to reinforce my skills.<sup>24</sup> If given the chance, I would want a certificate or degree in graphic design.<sup>25</sup> This is because I am also interested in <strong>productions</strong>, either in television series or movies.<sup>26</sup> I love seeing <abbr title="Visual Effects">VFX</abbr>, <abbr title="Computer-Generated Imagery">CGI</abbr>, kinetic graphic design, and other kinds of design in moving pictures.<sup>27</sup> <strong>My interests are dynamic</strong>.<sup>28</sup> I am sure that I'll have more interests, or lose interests in the following years.<sup>29</sup> All I am sure of is that <em>each interest that I have plays an important role in defining who I am</em>.<sup>30</sup>
