            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I was born in Marikina</em>, though most of my childhood memories took place in <strong>San Mateo, Rizal</strong>.<sup>1</sup> It was there where my family lived for a long time, because my older siblings had to attend school there.<sup>2</sup> <em>We weren't blessed with wealth, nor a complete family</em>.<sup>3</sup> But thanks to our relatives overseas, and to my mother who worked herself to the bone, we didn't have to let a day pass without eating.<sup>4</sup> My environment there was nice.<sup>5</sup> Our neighbors were very kind, and based on the stories, they loved seeing me run all over the neighborhood.<sup>6</sup> My cousins also visited our house at times, so we were able to play.<sup>7</sup> Some of my cousins moved into the neighborhood as well, so we saw each other more frequently.<sup>8</sup> Together, we made friends with other kids in the neighborhood.<sup>9</sup> One unforgettable memory that I have was the first time that <strong>I got to go to the river</strong>.<sup>10</sup> Not just the bridge, but the <em>actual</em> waters of the river.<sup>11</sup> I was happy just to be able to actually feel the stream across my legs.<sup>12</sup> It was also in my childhood that <strong>I learned how to ride a bike</strong>, though my friend from my school had to scare me by chasing me so that I could keep pedaling.<sup>13</sup> I also <strong>had fun in school</strong>.<sup>14</sup> I no longer remember memories from nursery up to preparatory school, other than the daily commute with my mom to my school.<sup>15</sup> I remember we would stop at a <em>Pandayan</em> branch in Marikina for her to buy me snacks and drinks to bring to school.<sup>16</sup> After preparatory school, I started first grade in the same school as my older siblings.<sup>17</sup> It was a new environment, but I managed to fit in properly.<sup>18</sup> The <strong>funniest memory</strong> I have from my early grade school is when <strong>I didn't like my Mathematics teacher</strong> so I reported her directly to the Student Affairs Office.<sup>19</sup> My mom was called to school because of that, and I think she talked to the teacher and then things were great afterwards.<sup>20</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of things happened midway.<sup>21</sup> I had to study in a public school, and I had my worst experience there.<sup>22</sup> A classmate of mine accidentally cut my palm with a bamboo stick, and I had to get it stitched.<sup>23</sup> After that year, I went back to my old school.<sup>24</sup> My late grade school memories was <strong>my obsession with Geronimo Stilton books</strong>.<sup>25</sup> They were easy to read for me, and the stories were very imaginative.<sup>26</sup> I remember my library debt <em>piling up</em> because I take <em>too long</em> before I returned them.<sup>27</sup> Also, when I was in fifth grade, that was the time that <strong>I started to question my sexuality</strong>.<sup>28</sup> In sixth grade, my family <strong>had to move to Marikina</strong>, so I changed schools during my last school year.<sup>29</sup> It was <em>again</em> a new environment, and this time I found it harder to fit in because the culture was different from my old school.<sup>30</sup> To make things harder, I was <strong>elected as the section president</strong>.<sup>31</sup> Leading wasn't something I am capable of during the time, so our section had the reputation of being the <em><q>worst</q></em> and <em><q>lawless</q></em>.<sup>32</sup> It was so bad that my section adviser had to <em>disregard the entire set of class officers</em>.<sup>33</sup> Though my position remained, it was no longer good.<sup>34</sup> That was then I realized that I was missing out on a lot of fun.<sup>35</sup> When that happened, <strong>I started to make a lot of friends within my section</strong>, and then started to resolve conflicts between me and other classmates little-by-little.<sup>36</sup> I am happy that it went well towards the end, given that it was the end of my childhood and the start of my teenage life.<sup>37</sup></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage life started <em>halfway through seventh grade</em>.<sup>1</sup> This was a period of my life wherein <strong>I encountered a lot of changes</strong>.<sup>2</sup> Puberty was one thing, but there have also been changes with the way I think, the way I feel about others, and the way I see myself.<sup>3</sup> <strong>I wasn't very focused on studying</strong> during my early teenage years.<sup>4</sup> Instead, I was studying for the purpose of <em>making friends</em> with a lot of people.<sup>5</sup> By that time, I have already established friendship with several people.<sup>6</sup> I also <strong>discovered my passion for singing</strong>, and learned the most basic way of playing guitar.<sup>7</sup> By eigth grade, I found myself in a relationship with my <em>first official girlfriend</em>.<sup>8</sup> I learned a lot of things from her, and although it was days short of an anniversary, we separated in good terms.<sup>9</sup> After that, <strong>I became more and more confused with my sexuality</strong>.<sup>10</sup> I didn't know if I was heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual.<sup>11</sup> That lasted for quite a long time, and I started being infatuated towards multiple people, male and female.<sup>12</sup> <strong>By ninth grade, I started studying seriously</strong>.<sup>13</sup> I became hard on myself because I didn't want to slack off, especially since there were also problems regarding my family's financial stability.<sup>14</sup> I then realized that <em>I had to balance things out</em>.<sup>15</sup> So in tenth grade, I studied seriously but still made time for fun with friends.<sup>16</sup> In those last two years of Junior High School, I was <strong>active at a Christian church</strong> where my friends invited me.<sup>17</sup> It was fun for the most part, I made church friends and had fun with them as well.<sup>18</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I moved up from Junior High School with a fairly high grade, and <em>I had to leave my school to study at UE for Senior High School</em>.<sup>19</sup> It was a new environment, but at this point I knew that it didn't matter much if I didn't fit in, and since I've learned how to socialize with people, I could easily talk to them.<sup>20</sup> This time, I was very focused with studying.<sup>21</sup> It was a way for me to redirect my stress and bitterness from having to move to another school while my friends stayed.<sup>22</sup> In my last year of Senior High School, I met my <strong>first official boyfriend</strong>.<sup>23</sup> It was also this time that I have made my sexuality clear: I am <abbr title="Not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.">pansexual</abbr>.<sup>24</sup> I had fun, because I got to live my authentic self.<sup>25</sup> Of course, my friends from my previous school have also heard the news.<sup>26</sup> It was also the time that I officially came out to my family, and they have fully accepted me.<sup>27</sup> I finished Senior High School <em>with honors</em>, as well as with new friends that I still talk to until now.<sup>28</sup> My relationship with my boyfriend was also days short of an anniversary, but it peacefully ended after a long period of uncertainty.<sup>29</sup> I've learned a lot about myself during Senior High School, especially the fact that I have been hurt by a lot of things that happened to me in the past.<sup>30</sup> A lot of things happened during these two years, and <strong>while most of them have been instrumental to my growth, some of them have been quite detrimental.</strong><sup>31</sup></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My college years have been <strong>a change of pace</strong>.<sup>1</sup> The pandemic started right before my first year of college, so <strong>my experience is very unique</strong> from other batches of students.<sup>2</sup> I put myself under <em>so much pressure</em>, so that I'll always do better everytime I get the chance to.<sup>3</sup> I've also been isolated with my thoughts, and they don't help me much.<sup>4</sup> I am much happier in college though, because I am <strong>much more focused</strong> on things that I am interested in.<sup>5</sup> Even if this program is <em>only second</em> to the one that I wanted most, I still feel like I will do good.<sup>6</sup> I also cannot believe that I will easily make friends.<sup>7</sup> My childhood friend also became my classmate, <em>for the first time</em>.<sup>8</sup> It was a funny story because we've known each other for a while but we never became classmates back in Junior High School.<sup>9</sup> Well, I am happy that he is my classmate now.<sup>10</sup> I also am classmates once again with a friend from Senior High School, and I cannot believe that our friendship will go deeper.<sup>11</sup> That was because back then, we did not belong to the same circle, and we only had a quality moment when we were grouped together for our research.<sup>12</sup> Nonetheless, she is a great friend.<sup>13</sup> I have also made friends with <em>three</em> other graduates from UE's Basic Education Department.<sup>14</sup> Though, one of us decided that BSIT is not the course he should be taking, so he moved to another university and took up something related to health sciences.<sup>15</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>From six, we became five</strong>.<sup>16</sup> Don't get me wrong, us six still have a strong connection and always keeps in touch.<sup>17</sup> I've also made friends with people I didn't think I would be friends with.<sup>18</sup> And it's great that I got to see some of them in person already.<sup>19</sup> It is a <strong>healthy relationship</strong>, if I were to be asked.<sup>20</sup> We would all be of help to each other whenever one of us needs it.<sup>21</sup> And everyone would go out of their way just to keep everyone in check.<sup>22</sup> It's like an <strong><em>unwritten rule of accountability</em></strong>.<sup>23</sup> <ins>Others treat college life as an individual battleground, but we see it as an opportunity for cooperation.</ins><sup>24</sup> I've also met outstanding professors who were very passionate to teach.<sup>25</sup> Yes, Prof. Ventura. <em>You</em> are one of them.<sup>26</sup> While I also had my share of professors who I didn't see eye-to-eye with, I still know and understand that they have their personal struggles.<sup>27</sup> Nonetheless, <strong>a minor inconvenience will do little to no damage on my passion for learning</strong>.<sup>28</sup> I am still almost halfway through college, so I still have not much to say.<sup>29</sup> All I know is that I am having fun with the people around me so far.<sup>30</sup> I hope to keep that happiness around until we graduate and go about the rest of our lives.<sup>31</sup> I sure hope that the relationships I built at this point will not be easily disposable.<sup>32</sup></p>
